                <p class="text-small" style="color: white;">The next generation of games is here, releasing the newest consoles, from the PS5
                    and Xbox Series X to the Oculus Quest 2. They're bringing into play factors that have been
                    influencing every new generation of games: graphics, processing power, and online connectivity. This
                    year is no different, except that all three are being revolutionised in unprecedented ways.Graphics
                    have always been a big part of what makes a console a generational leap. The PS3 brought us
                    high-definition graphics; the PS4 Pro brought us 4K resolution. The PS5 will bring us ray tracing -
                    a technology that has made its way into gaming from movie production, where it's used to create
                    effects like glow and reflections in real-time. It means incredibly realistic lighting effects that
                    give you more immersion than ever before.</p>
